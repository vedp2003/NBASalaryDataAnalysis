## Key Steps implemented in this project

### Data Preprocessing and Cleaning
1. Merged the player statistics and salary datasets to include player performance statistics, positions, teams, and salaries. This involved joining the datasets on common attributes. 
2. Handled missing values and outliers across key features like points, assists, rebounds, and salary. This involved data cleaning, handling Null Values, and removing outliers using the Z-Score Method.
3. Converted numerical columns to the appropriate data types for mathematical operations.
4. Standardized features and scaled data where necessary.

### Feature Engineering
We derived new variables from existing ones to better capture underlying patterns in the data.
1. **Weighted Efficiency (WEFF)**: Combines points, assists, rebounds, steals, blocks, and turnovers, normalized by games played.
2. **Points Per Game (PPG)**: Points scored divided by games played.
3. **Assists Per Game (APG)**: Assists divided by games played.
4. **Rebounds Per Game (RPG)**: Total rebounds divided by games played.
5. **Steals Per Game (SPG)**: Steals divided by games played.
6. **Blocks Per Game (BPG)**: Blocks divided by games played.
7. **Turnovers Per Game (TPG)**: Turnovers divided by games played.
8. **Usage Rate**: Estimate of a player's involvement in offensive plays, based on field goals attempted, free throws attempted, and turnovers.
9. **Shooting Efficiency**: Average of field goal percentage and effective field goal percentage.
10. **Offensive Contribution**: Weighted sum of points, assists, and offensive rebounds.
11. **Defensive Contribution**: Sum of defensive rebounds, steals, and blocks.
12. **Experience**: Estimated years of professional activity, assuming players start their careers at age 19.
13. **Games Started Percentage (GS%)**: Games started as a percentage of games played.
14. **Impact Score**: Weighted Efficiency (WEFF) per minute played
15. **Minutes Played per game (MPG): Total minutes played divided by games played
16. **Efficiency Tiers**: Players categorized into low, moderate, and high efficiency tiers.
   
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
1. **Visualization**:
   - Created plots to see the correlation of different metrics with Salary to find which metric was important.
   - Made visualizations for each numeric metric vs salary to find the best features for predicting salary 
   - Some plots we made include: 
      - Visualized salary trends by position, efficiency, and season using bar plots, scatter plots, and line plots.
      - Created more salary related visualizations to better see trends for predicting overall salary based on player stats and performance.

### SQL Integration
1. Created a relational SQLite database for querying player statistics.
2. Build a schema and then inserted our dataset information in the local database
3. Executed advanced SQL queries for aspects such as:
   - Analyzed salary trends in relation to NBA player stats, performance metrics, and efficiency.
   - Explored year-on-year salary growth and distribution across seasons.
   - Examined salary variations across different age groups and career stages.
   - Investigated the impact of specific contributions (offensive/defensive) and efficiency on player earnings

4. By incorporating database management, we were able to easily query and find salary related trends, helping us build the overall machine learning model.

### Machine Learning Models
1. **Linear Regression**:
   - Established a baseline model for salary prediction. This model didnt perform too well. 
   - Evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R² score.
2. **Decision Tree Regressor**:
   - Improved prediction accuracy by capturing non-linear relationships. It uses decision trees to predict.
3. **Neural Network**:
    - Uses a network of nodes (with one hidden layer using a greedy optimization approach) 
5. **Random Forest Regressor**:
   - Enhanced the model by reducing overfitting and improving robustness. This works by combining the predictions of multiple decision trees. This turned out to be the best model with a relatively high R² value. 

### Advanced Statistic Concepts 
1. **PRESS, Cp, Bootstrapping, K-fold cross-validation**:
   - Helped evaluate the model's performance and analyze how robust it was
     
### Local Dashboard
1. Integrated an user interactive dashboard using `ipywidgets` to dynamically input player statistics and predict salaries.
2. Added a slider and textboxs for value inputs. 
3. Used a trained Random Forest Regressor model (best performing model) to predict salaries dynamically.
4. Displayed predicted salaries after button click to create an user friendly dashboard.

### Interactive Web Dashboard
1. Developed a web-based interactive dashboard using Dash for dynamic player salary predictions.
2. Integrated sliders and dropdowns for real-time input of player stats.
3. Displayed predicted salaries using the best-performing Random Forest Regressor model.
4. Enhanced user accessibility with visual styling, animations, and responsiveness for mobile devices.
5. This is deployed using Netlify. Here is the link:

## Flow of the Project

1. **Setup and Environment**:
   - Clone this repository and open the Jupyter Notebook file `finalProj.ipynb` in a Python notebook platform like Jupyter Notebook or CodeBench.

2. **Data Import**:
   - The notebook imports multiple `.csv` files containing player statistics/info and salaries. This was downloaded fromthe Kaggle data link. 
   - Reads and retrieves the data using `pandas` and merges datasets into a consolidated DataFrame.

3. **Data Cleaning and Processing**:
   - Handles missing values and outliers.
   - Converts numerical columns to appropriate data types.
   - Performs feature engineering to calculate metrics like Weighted Efficiency (WEFF).

4. **Visualization**:
   - Creates various plots and charts (e.g., bar plots, scatter plots, heatmaps) to understand trends and relationships in the data.
   - Analyzes salary trends by season, player position, and efficiency tiers.

5. **SQL Queries**:
   - Transfers the data into an SQLite database.
   - Executes queries to analyze salary trends, identify top players, evaluate team performance, etc. 

6. **Machine Learning**:
   - Trains models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Nueral Network, Random Forest) to predict salaries based on player performance metrics.
   - Evaluates models using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R² score.
   - Create robust models that can help predict NBA player salaries in future seasons/years given their current stats/performance.
     
7. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Applies statistical concepts such as PRESS and Mallow's Cp to choose the best model and see its performance
   - Performs bootstrapping to evaluate the final model's performance on multiple resampled training sets to get 95% confidence intervals for Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² scores.
   - Does k-fold cross validation by splitting the dataset into k subsets (folds). The model is trained on k-1 folds and tested on the remaining fold, repeating the process k times so that each fold serves as the test set once. This method ensures that the model is tested on different subsets of          data, providing a robust estimate of its performance.
     
8. **Local Dashboard**:
   - Implements an user interacgive dashboard using `ipywidgets` to allow users to input player stats dynamically.
   - Predicts salaries using the best performing model (Random Forest Regressor) and displays results interactively.

9.  **Web Dashboard**:
   - Deployed an interactive Dash-based web application for real-time salary predictions for users.
